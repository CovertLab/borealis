    To run on Google Compute Engine (GCE), the VM needs access Scopes:
        Storage Read Write (storage-rw)
    and its Service Account needs Permissions:
        Logs Writer
        Storage Object Admin

    To run off GCE, configure a service account "fireworker" with the above
    permissions, get its private key as a json file:
        PROJECT="$(gcloud config get-value core/project)"
        FIREWORKER_KEY="${HOME}/bin/fireworker.json"
        gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "${FIREWORKER_KEY}" \
            --iam-account "fireworker@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    and append an `export` statement to the shell .profile:
        echo "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=${FIREWORKER_KEY}" >> ~/.profile
